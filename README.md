<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Time Prison is a 2D platformer game that challenges the players to use trial and error to escape the labyrinth. Players must navigate through a treacherous set of obstacles with deceptive physics while learning from their mistakes and repeating their attempts in order to progress. It contains three checkpoints, with each one gradually increasing in difficulty as the player puzzles their way through the game. Players must use their knowledge and understanding of the levels to outsmart the obstacles and eventually escape the Time Prison.
